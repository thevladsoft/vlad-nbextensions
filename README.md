**Three plugins for IPython2**

Copy to .ipython/nbextensions and add: IPython.load_extensions('file name without .js'); to custom.js_

autodetach-dirty.js: Makes help to automatically detach. Includes a button to toggle behavior

kate-commenter.js: Allows to comment with ctrl-d or ctrl-shift-d, just becaues I'm used to that shorcut on kate/kwrite

move-helpbutton-dirty.js: really silly, but it helps me: it move the tiny "Open the pager in an external window" button on non-detached pager to the right, so this and close button are in the same side (came on, I think thats logicall).
